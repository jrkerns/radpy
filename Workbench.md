# Introduction #

Unfortunately, the Enthought workbench plugin is still in an early stage of development.  This means that documentation is pretty much non-existent.  Fortunately, the developers are very good about answering questions on the enthought-dev mailing list.  This page is an attempt to compile all the information gleaned from combing the enthought-dev archives.  THIS IS NOT AN AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE.  The information here may not be correct, and if it conflicts with something on the Enthought web site, then the web site is probably correct.
