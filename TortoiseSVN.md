# Introduction #

TortoiseSVN is a Windows shell extension that allows Subversion commands to be executed on folders in Windows Explorer.

# Details #

The TortoiseSVN client can be found at the [TortoiseSVN webpage](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads).  Once installed, to check out the current version of RadPy, open a Windows explorer window.  Browse to the folder you wish to place the RadPy source in.  Right click and select 'SVN Checkout'.  For the URL use 'http://radpy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RadPy'.
Click 'Ok'.

Once the source code is checked out, you can right click on the RadPy folder and select from various Subversion commands such as 'SVN Commit...', 'SVN update', and 'TortoiseSVN/Create patch ...'.
