# Introduction #

Contributing to the RadPy code base is one of the best ways to help out with the project.  RadPy is written in Python, using PyQt as the GUI library.  It uses many projects from the Enthought Tool Suite including Traits, TraitsGUI, Chaco and Envisage.  Knowledge of Python and some familiarity with the Enthought Tool Suite is essential. TraitsGUI is a wrapper around PyQt, so knowledge of PyQt is not mandatory.  TraitsGUI is easier to learn, but does not utilize the full feature set of PyQt.  Documentation for all of these can be found in the links section below.
