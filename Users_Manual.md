# Introduction #

RadPy is intended to be used to analyze and compare radiation therapy beam data from various sources.  Examples of this include:
  * Comparing dose distributions calculated from treatment planning systems to those obtained from scans using a 3D water phantom.
  * Comparing water phantom scans to a reference set to judge constancy of the beam profiles.

Features of the current release (version 0.1) of Radpy include:
  * Reading .rfb files generated by IBA Dosimetry's <a href='http://www.iba-dosimetry.com/complete-solutions/radiotherapy/relative-dosimetry/omnipro-accept'>OmniPro-Accept</a> software.
  * Support for DICOM RT plan and RT dose files.
  * Plotting and overlaying depth dose curves and inplane and crossplane profiles using <a href='http://enthought.com/'>Enthought's</a> Chaco plotting library.
  * Automatic detection of matching profiles from a set of RFB scans or DICOM dose files.
  * A plugin architecture based on <a href='http://enthought.com/'>Enthought's</a> Envisage library.
  * An open format for beam data storage (BDML) plus the ability to read from  or write to that format.
